## General Topic :

My topic of study is the field of artificial intelligence such as neural networks and machine learning.  To be more specific, I’m planning to narrow down my research to image-processing with AI.  A few examples of this are **image-upscaling** algorithms and **style transfer** as well.

**Image upscaling** is when an algorithm takes a low-resolution image and upscales the image to a larger resolution while also making the image crisper by deciding how details should be added.

**Style transfer** is the process of transferring the theme of one image to another image with the use of neural networks.

## Reason for Study :

The main reason I’m focusing on artificial intelligence is due to how interesting the topics in my Artificial Intelligence were.  Machine learning and neural networks can solve problems that normal algorithms cannot and they can be used throughout many different fields.  Since I’m minoring in Art, Science, and Innovation, I wanted to focus on an Art themed project so that is why I’m researching super-resolution and style transfer tech.

## Research Performed :

So far, the beginning research I’ve performed was looking for a paper dealing with the topic I’m focusing on and finding a piece of software that incorporates these ideas as well. 

The paper that I have found was [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6_43).  It deals with a super-resolution neural network that is optimized for real-time use while still having accurate upscaling results compared to other algorithms.  It also allows for real-time style transfer with less artifacts than normal networks in use at the moment.  For example, here are some results of the network compared to results of other algorithms :

The software that I was able to find is called [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN).  Real-ESRGAN is a useful tool that can upscale images and videos for effective digital restoration.  It uses a custom neural network model to perform these jobs.  A few examples of the tool and its results are below :
