### Survey Article from the literature

 - **Citation of the article**

Egmont-Petersen, Michael, Dick de Ridder, and Heinz Handels. "Image processing with neural networksâ€”a review." Pattern recognition 35.10 (2002): 2279-2301.

 - **In two or three sentences, discuss the goals of this article.**

 The goal of the article is to review 200 different types of algorithms for neural networks.  The networks in particular are used in image processing tasks, and the paper attempts to identify their strengths and weaknesses in the different tasks associated with image processing.

 - **What is /are the general task(s) that all the methods address in the article?**

 The tasks addressed in the article are jobs the network can perform effectively and the ones they cannot.  These jobs are preprocessing, feature extraction, segmentation, object recognition, image understanding, and image optimization functions.

 - **What are some of the leading methods introduced and discussed in this paper?**

 The different neural network methods are the most recent networks at the time from different papers for differing tasks they were designed for.  For example, the article addresses useful image restoration algorithms such as GANFs and fuzzy ANNs.

 - **What is the context of the discussion of these methods? For instance, are there demonstrations in light of some task that they address?**

 The methods are being discussed to address the future usage, categorization, and potential of numerous neural networks for differing image processing tasks.

 - **How can some of these methods be used in your own work? What purpose would the method serve in your work?**

The methods in the article are useful for my own work since it is important to know which neural network algorithms are best for image restoration rather than other tasks such as image segmentation.  Also, there are many useful references to other articles on image restoration within the review, so I can read those as well to get a better understanding of individual methods.

### First article from the literature

 - **Citation of the article**

Dong, Chao, Chen Change Loy, and Xiaoou Tang. "Accelerating the super-resolution convolutional neural network." European conference on computer vision. Springer, Cham, 2016.

 - **What is the goal of this article?**

The goal of the article is to develop upon a previous image restoration neural network to increase the speed at which it accomplishes its tasks.

 - **In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.**

 The SRCNN, or Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network, is an AI that has demonstrated superior upscaling of images compared to other algorithms.  However, the method suffers from speed constraints, running at only around 1 FPS, which is far from real-time.  The main goal of the article is to improve upon the SRCNN to increase speed of the algorithm to around 40x at 24 FPS for real-time usage.  This is done through the proposed changes to the SRCNN's network structure which impose limitations to its running speed.

### Second article from the literature

 - **Citation of the article**

Schulter, Samuel, Christian Leistner, and Horst Bischof. "Fast and accurate image upscaling with super-resolution forests." Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2015.

 - **What is the goal of this article?**

The purpose/goal of the article is to develop an accurate image upscaling algorithm that doesn't have speed constraints compared to other similar methods currently.

 - **In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.**

 Image upscaling algorithms have many uses from applications in medical to astronomical fields.  However, current methods suffer from speed issues, and therefore are rendered unfeasible for mass or constant usage.  The goal of the paper is to develop a usable, quick image upscaling algorithm.  The way the authors of the article go about this process is through the use of super-resolution random forests.  Using the methods that they put together, they were able to achieve an algorithm that produces state of the art results while having the training and evaluation of the method remain quick.
