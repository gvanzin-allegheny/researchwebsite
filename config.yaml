    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/imaged.png"
    content: |-
      Ever since I was a child, I have had a fascination with computers and how they work.  After beginning high school, I learned my school offered a programming course and knew I had to take it.  This led me on the path I'm at now studying to become a software developer at Allegheny College.

      While I tend to jump around to a variety of different fields when it comes to projects, my main interest lie in game development and artifical intelligence.  I find the two fascinating as through game development you can bring your ideas to life (well on screen), amd artifical intelligence helps you to automate the process in different ways.

      I am looking forward to learning much more as I go forward academically and career-wise in these fields.
